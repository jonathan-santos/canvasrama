    <h1>Canvasrama</h1>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Canvasrama is a game framework made with javascript to create 2D games using the Canvas API.</p>

    <h2>What the name means?</h2>
    <p>It is the combination of the words Canvas and Fliperama (portuguese for arcade). Canvas + Fliperama = Canvasrama!</p>

    <h2>Just Why?</h2>
    <p>I've made it because I wanted a place to keep the results of my studies of the book A LÃ³gica do jogo of Marcus Becker. In the book he teaches how to make games using Java, but since I'm a Web person, I've decided to translate it to Javascript + Canvas, in order to be more fun.</p>
