# Canvasrama
## What is it?
Canvasrama is a game framework made with javascript to create 2D games using the Canvas API. 

## What the name means?
It is the combination of the words Canvas and Fliperama (portuguese for arcade). Canvas + Fliperama = Canvasrama!

## Just Why?
I've made it because I wanted a place to keep the results of my studies of the book [A LÃ³gica do jogo](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-logica-jogo) of [Marcus Becker](https://github.com/marcusbecker). In the book he teaches how to make games using Java, but since I'm a Web person, I've decided to translate it to Javascript + Canvas, in order to be more fun.
